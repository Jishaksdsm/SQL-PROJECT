SQL Project: Human Development Index


Description

This SQL project focuses on analyzing data related to the Human Development Index (HDI). The Human Development Index is a measure of a country's overall development based on factors such as life expectancy, education, and income. In this project, we will explore a dataset containing information about various countries and their corresponding HDI values.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Country: The name of the country.
Human_Development: The development level category of the country.
Human_Development_Index (HDI): The numerical value of the country's HDI.
Life_expectancy_at_birth: The life expectancy at birth in years.
Expected_years_of_schooling: The expected years of schooling.
Mean_years_of_schooling: The mean years of schooling.
Gross_national_income: The country's gross national income.
GNI_per_capita_rank_minus_HDI_rank: The difference between GNI per capita rank and HDI rank.
HDI_rank: The rank of the country based on its HDI value.
Project Goals
The main goals of this SQL project are as follows:

Retrieve and analyze data related to HDI, such as the highest and lowest HDI values.
Investigate the correlation between HDI and specific indicators such as life expectancy and education.
Calculate summary statistics, such as average HDI and median GNI per capita.
Identify countries with the highest HDI values and their corresponding development levels.
Explore the relationship between GNI per capita rank and HDI rank.
Project Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Create a new database in your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL).
Create a table in the database to store the data, with columns corresponding to the dataset columns.
Import the dataset into the table, ensuring that the data types and column names match.
Connect to the database using the appropriate credentials.
Execute SQL queries to perform the desired analysis.
